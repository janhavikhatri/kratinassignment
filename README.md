Step-2)

We can connect various elderly people through the

application so that they can form a group and can

share similar lifestyles. We can also provide a to-do list

the user cannot get confused.

We can add a lot of features so that it can help people to live healthily.
Code:

class test[

public static void main(String[] args){

System.out.println("Everyday health chart");

System.out.println("1.wakeup->6.30am");

System.out.println("2.yoga->7am-7.30am");

System.out.println("3.breakfast->9am");

System.out.println("4.walk->10min");

System.out.println("6.walk->15min");

System.out.println("7.evening walk and snacks");

System.out.println("8.dinner 8pm");

System.out.println("9.walk->20min");
